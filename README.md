## TO-DO (May be incomplete)
- [ ] Redo the complete app shutdown process – Detected by antivirus as suspicious behavior.
- [ ] Improve support for multi-threading – Many variables are not accessible between GUI & App Logic.
- [ ] Pre-build GUI when the application start - If GUI is not opened by USER, the logger can't work correctly.
- [ ] Fix start-up permission error - Cannot access /configs folder
